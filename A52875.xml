         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But that Cloud by the good Providence of God, and the wi≈øe proceeding of Parliament, ≈øcattering as it were of it ≈øelf, and <hi>Serenity of State</hi> returning, Tho≈øe Reverend Per≈øons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove named (who≈øe further encouragement and a≈ø≈øi≈øtance (to ≈øpeak the truth) was of nece≈ø≈øity to have been afforded to the Publication of them) judg'd it not fit to hinder the quiet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øure of things, by ca≈øting in ought that might move di≈øpute, mini≈øter talk, or ≈øerve to keep on foot publick jealou≈øies, and di≈øcontents. So they have lain ever ≈øince in the ≈øame private Manu≈øcript, in which they were fir≈øt drawn up. But (as it happens by the ≈øame Permi≈ø≈øion, and order of Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence)
<pb facs="tcp:52641:3"/>the face of publick affairs beginning now again to change ≈øo much to the wor≈øe, and the pre≈øent state of things ≈øo evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confirming, and fully ju≈øtifying tho≈øe <hi>General fears, ≈øu≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions,</hi> and <hi>jealou≈øies,</hi> which the Writer of the≈øe following <hi>Propo≈øitions</hi> profe≈ø≈øes to have had, and to have laboured under a long time together; to the end, that our great, and high-contra≈øting Animo≈øities do not hurry us unawares, into irreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diable Evils, the Author hath now a ≈øecond time given his con≈øent to their Publication, in the ≈øame form and manner, and without any great alteration from what they were in the fir≈øt Copy: Verily judging the Contents, if well and duly con≈øider'd, may, with God's ble≈ø≈øing going along with them; ≈øerve in this juncture of time as ≈øo many <hi>≈øea≈øonable Retentives,</hi> to hold us back from running ≈øo ha≈øtily and headlong to our own ruine; or as ≈øo many <hi>gentle ≈øuffu≈øions</hi> to correct, and cool the vehemency of our di≈øtempered heats.</p>
               <p>It is therefore, both by the Author and Publi≈øher, heartily wi≈øh'd and de≈øir'd, that his <hi>private Thoughts,</hi> hereby made <hi>publick,</hi> might be ≈øo happy, as to come to the knowledge, and be thoroughly reflected upon by all the good People of this Nation: and particularly, I cannot but prompt to them tho≈øe Propo≈øitions which concern, and ≈øhew the means of Cementing our Unhappy differences, and thereby fru≈øtrating the hopes and De≈øigns our Enemies have upon us, by rea≈øon of them; which are Propp. <hi>24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32.</hi> Tho≈øe al≈øo that di≈øcover, and lay open the various, and ≈øubtle practices of our great Enemy (the <hi>Roman Con≈øi≈øtory</hi> and its <hi>Emi≈ø≈øaries</hi>) to kindle, and keep up Di≈ø≈øen≈øions amongst us, and by means of them in fine to ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject us, not ≈øo much to the obedience of True Religion (which they neither regard, nor care for, but only for their Intere≈øts ≈øake) as to their own arbitrary Wills, Pride, Tyranny, and Super≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: Which likewi≈øe, if God permit, and that moderate Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øels take not better place with us, they will infallibly effect fir≈øt or la≈øt.

<pb facs="tcp:52641:3"/>and Intere≈øts, Affections, Endeavours, and All what≈øoever we have, or can make u≈øe of for common defence, in ≈øuch manner as is hinted in the above-mention'd Propp. <hi>24, 25, 26, &amp;c.</hi> But for their practices, ≈øee Propp. <hi>7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 23.</hi> And finally, that we do not omit to con≈øider what is ≈øaid concerning the Je≈øuits immen≈øe Wealth, mo≈øt <hi>unlawfully</hi> gotten, and rak'd together, and of its perilous importance to all Princes, and States what≈øoever, where they have the like ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, and do practi≈øe the like indu≈øtries for the ama≈ø≈øing wealth in a clande≈øtine, and le≈øs perceived way. Neither do the Monks (or other Religious, I ≈øuppo≈øe) fall much ≈øhort of their proportion in each kind, that is, of having, and po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øing exce≈ø≈øive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-≈øuperfluous Mammon, or Riches, and of avaritious indu≈øtry, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, and de≈øire to get more. For this, as relating to the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øuits e≈øpecially, ≈øee Propp. <hi>33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 41.</hi> And for the Intere≈øt and Power, the Con≈øi≈øtory, and they, <hi>Viz.</hi> the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øuits, Monks, and Friers, have al≈øo now gained, and do at pre≈øent hold, and drive on out of Chri≈øtendom, that is, in the <hi>Turki≈øh, Per≈øian,</hi> and <hi>Chine≈øe</hi> Empires, ≈øee Propp. <hi>48.</hi> to the end of the Di≈øcour≈øe.</p>
               <p>Now concerning the Author, or Writer of the following mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, there needs no more be inquir'd, or ≈øaid of him, than what him≈øelf confe≈ø≈øeth in the Title-page, <hi>viz.</hi> that he is, as to matter of Faith and Religion, of the Roman-Catholick Communion; but yet <hi>a Loyal Subject,</hi> and one that hates all kind of di≈øloyalty (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in opinion or practice) as much as any Prote≈øtant in <hi>England:</hi> of which he is al≈øo ready at all times (when requir'd) to give the best a≈ø≈øurance he can, and the utmo≈øt that the Law requires of the Subjects of this Nation: being indeed one, who≈øe private condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion con≈øidered, cannot ea≈øily be thought to have any de≈øign in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øhing the≈øe his <hi>Sentiments,</hi> more than to be (under God) ≈øome little means of helping to prevent the manifold Confu≈øions, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, mi≈øeries, deva≈øtations and bloud-≈øhed, which tho≈øe hasty and precipitate Coun≈øels, that ≈øome are found too ready to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, partly out of a mi≈øtaken zeal for Religion, (which is in
<pb facs="tcp:52641:4"/>truth meer animo≈øity and haughtine≈øs of ≈øpirit) and partly for their own private ends, will certainly in ≈øhort time bring upon his native Country, far more grievous, than any they have yet felt, or ≈øeen in War. And therefore prayeth, that his good and dutiful Intentions being accepted, his over≈øights (in ca≈øe any ≈øuch be found to have ≈ølipt his Pen, worthy of remarque) may receive a mild cen≈øure, and be look'd upon as the Effects (for ≈øo they are, I appeal to God) of a mo≈øt pure, and inten≈øe affection for the good of this Nation in general; and in particular for the Health and Well-being of his Maje≈øties Royal Per≈øon, for his ≈øafety and pre≈øervation from all dangers, publick or private, and for his long, happy, and peaceful Reign over us: likewi≈øe (as duty requires) for the health and happy return (when it ≈øhall be ≈øafe for him) of his Royal Highne≈øs: and in the mean time for the inviolate Con≈øervation of all his Princely Rights, Titles, Dignities, and Prerogatives to him and his Heirs; and for the fru≈øtrating of all tho≈øe de≈øperate and de≈øtructive Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øels and Practices, which are ≈øaid to be carried on for the di≈øinheriting of his Royal Highne≈øs becau≈øe of his Religion: than which de≈øign, nothing ever was, or can be thought of, more Unadvi≈øed, and tending to the Nations ruine; or that doth more evidently proclaim it ≈øelf to be the very coun≈øel, and project of tho≈øe our deadly enemies here complain'd of: who have by ≈øome of their hired, or brib'd Agents among≈øt us, clancularly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derhand procur'd it to be ≈øet on foot, on purpo≈øe to involve us in endle≈øs and inextricable troubles, contentions and mi≈øchiefs following upon them; from which God in mercy deliver Us, and cau≈øe us to ≈øee (I ≈øay not only the iniquity, inju≈øtice, illegal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of the Project, which are apparent to every eye, but) the manife≈øt impo≈ø≈øibility of ever carrying it on, and maintaining it again≈øt ≈øo many and great oppo≈øitions (both dome≈øtick and foreign) as will undoubtedly appear again≈øt it, when the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolution ≈øhall be once taken, and form'd into an Act of State: Which that it may never be, nor the traiterous phan≈øie ever be thought worthy of motion, but rather be look'd upon with
<pb facs="tcp:52641:4"/>horrour, and rejected with de≈øerv'd indignation by all the good Members of our en≈øuing Great Council, the Parliament, as al≈øo by all Good Patriots, Lovers and Well-wi≈øhers of their Countries publick, and common Good, Peace, Tranquillity, Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, more than their own Wills, private Pa≈ø≈øions, Intere≈øts, and Concerns, is, and ever ≈øhall be (as both Duty and Con≈øcience binds) the daily, and mo≈øt earne≈øt Prayer, of (Good Reader) Your loving Country-man, and mo≈øt hearty Well-wi≈øher of the Be≈øt Things to You from God.</p>

            <p>COncerning the bu≈øine≈øs, whereof I lately promi≈øed to give You ≈øome account by Writing, being a little ≈øtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in point of Time, I mu≈øt crave Your pardon, if you find not that good method and order ob≈øerv'd in the following Lines, which might have been wi≈øhed, and that I pre≈øume to deliver my Thoughts to You in ≈øuch an indige≈øted manner, as I fear I ≈øhall be forc'd to do for want of time, that is to ≈øay, not in the form of a continued, and coherent Di≈øcour≈øe, but of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtinct, ≈øeparate Propo≈øitions, ≈øet down ha≈øtily, as Things come to mind. However, I think this Benefit may come of the cour≈øe I intend, that delivering my ≈øelf in this manner, you will, perhaps, ≈øomewhat more di≈øtinctly, and particularly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive what my mind is, and what ≈øen≈øe and apprehen≈øion of things I have: which <hi>I</hi> confe≈øs is the principal thing <hi>I</hi> aim at; as well to ea≈øe my own mind, as to under≈øtand what yours will be of the whole matter. <hi>I</hi> can hardly doubt, but in ≈øome things you will think me a little too apprehen≈øive, and that I do over≈øhoot my ≈øelf in ≈øu≈øpicion. But for that <hi>(Gentlemen)</hi> appealing to God for the ≈øincerity of my profe≈ø≈øion herein, <hi>I</hi> think it ≈øufficient to ≈øay, it is a ca≈øe, wherein <hi>I</hi> had much ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be blam'd for want of <hi>Di≈øcretion,</hi> than for want of <hi>Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:</hi> and ≈øo <hi>I</hi> may be, though in never ≈øo low a degree, an
<pb facs="tcp:52641:6"/>occa≈øion, or means, of preventing the ≈øad mi≈øchief and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which <hi>I</hi> verily believe threatens this Church and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, from the practices of certain Men, who pretend Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on much, but mind it lea≈øt of all, <hi>I</hi> ≈øhall not be unwilling to be accounted a <hi>Fool,</hi> or <hi>Mad-man,</hi> if need be.</p>
            <p>As <hi>I</hi> have already told you, <hi>I</hi> can frame no particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu≈øation again≈øt any Per≈øon; but mu≈øt confe≈øs, my Fears and apprehen≈øions are only of <hi>dangers</hi> and <hi>ill practices</hi> in <hi>general,</hi> and for the mo≈øt part upon <hi>general pre≈øumptions</hi> and <hi>grounds:</hi> ≈øo that <hi>I</hi> cannot but doubt likewi≈øe, that this will be objected again≈øt me, and made a great argument by ≈øome to di≈øcredit what <hi>I</hi> ≈øay, <hi>Viz.</hi> that <hi>I</hi> do <hi>only ≈øu≈øpect,</hi> and <hi>not prove.</hi> But let them make their advantage of it. <hi>I</hi> am content to lye under this cen≈øure too for a while, rather than that my Country ≈øhould want the benefit of ≈øome timely admonition, and warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing given them, to beware, how they ≈øuffer them≈øelves to be practis'd upon, to their own and the publick ruine. Dangers of this nature mu≈øt be fear'd, and apprehended, a little before they evidence them≈øelves, or el≈øe God help us. For the ≈øati≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction (<hi>I</hi> hope) of all that will judge indifferently, it may ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, that with a clear con≈øcience <hi>I</hi> can, and do appeal to God, <hi>the ≈øearcher of hearts,</hi> that <hi>I</hi> ≈øugge≈øt nothing, either by way of charge, ≈øu≈øpicion, accu≈øation, or otherwi≈øe, which <hi>I</hi> do not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily conceive my ≈øelf to have <hi>ju≈øt and ≈øufficient ground</hi> to ≈øug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge≈øt, and to <hi>think,</hi> and <hi>≈øpeak</hi> of Things ≈øo as <hi>I</hi> do, either from <hi>their own printed Books,</hi> or from <hi>their private Writings</hi> (which <hi>I</hi> have at times ≈øeen, and tran≈øcribed for them) or from what <hi>I</hi> have <hi>heard from their own mouths,</hi> or <hi>the mouths of their friends</hi> and <hi>confidents:</hi> except only ≈øome few things, which here and there <hi>I</hi> collect, <hi>√† paritate rationis,</hi> or by way of argument, from what <hi>I</hi> have undoubtedly <hi>heard,</hi> or <hi>ob≈øerv'd</hi> from them≈øelves, and from <hi>their Books, Writings, Mouths,</hi> re≈øpectively.</p>
            <p>All that know, and duly con≈øider how indu≈øtrious this Party is, to pur≈øue and promote their proper Intere≈øt, will (I doubt not) acknowledge this for a truth, <hi>That what they hold
<pb facs="tcp:52641:6"/>lawful to be done, they may be ju≈øtly pre≈øum'd to do, when≈øoever opportunity ≈øerves, and that they ≈øee it conducible to their Intere≈øt to do it.</hi> Therefore to ≈øhew how they are principled in point of opinion, touching the lawfulne≈øs of the things here in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral charg'd upon them, or ≈øu≈øpected of them, I ≈øhall not forget, in convenient place, to in≈øert ≈øome few of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximes, ≈øerving to that purpo≈øe.</p>
            <p>One thing I have yet farther to add, not in the quality of a <hi>rea≈øon,</hi> to <hi>move others</hi> to regard what I ≈øay, (though it be, I confe≈øs, ≈øome little occa≈øion of <hi>≈øatisfaction to my ≈øelf</hi>) but only becau≈øe I judge it not improper to be imparted to you (my Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured Friends) and that I am particularly de≈øirous to hear your opinion of it. It is this: That being my ≈øelf a <hi>Roman Catholick,</hi> and frequenting the Sacrament of Confe≈ø≈øion, as Catholicks u≈øe to do, <hi>I</hi> have had frequent occa≈øion to mention the≈øe following matters, at lea≈øt the general Heads of them, to my (then) Gho≈øtly Fathers, as things that carried a ≈øemblance with them of <hi>very ra≈øh judgments</hi> again≈øt ≈øo <hi>great Superiours,</hi> and again≈øt <hi>Religious men,</hi> and upon that account as being <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ≈øin,</hi> or <hi>ju≈øt ≈øcruple,</hi> to me. But neither could <hi>I</hi> ever hear any thing from them, that gave me the lea≈øt ≈øatisfactory a≈ø≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the contrary, Viz. That <hi>it was not in any ≈øort ≈øo as I fear'd and ≈øu≈øpected</hi> of them, (though they were Je≈øuits, for the mo≈øt part, to whom <hi>I</hi> made my confe≈ø≈øion, and ≈øuch Men as could ea≈øily have given me a≈ø≈øurance, had they known it to be otherwi≈øe than <hi>I ≈øu≈øpected:</hi>) neither could <hi>I</hi> ever find any Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit by confe≈ø≈øing them. But though <hi>I</hi> have ever made it my earne≈øt Prayer to God, and ≈øtill do every day, that he would give me the grace to judge rightly and ju≈øtly of all Men, and not to be tran≈øported with any <hi>judgments,</hi> or <hi>≈øu≈øpicions</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning others, <hi>contrary to Truth and Charity:</hi> Yet the≈øe ≈øtill continue, and rather grow, and encrea≈øe upon me, than other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe, di≈øquieting my mind, more or le≈øs, almo≈øt every day; being commonly the la≈øt things that leave me at Night, and returning with the fir≈øt in the Morning. And this hath been
<pb facs="tcp:52641:7"/>my condition the≈øe many Years: Which ≈øeeing that my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience, on the other ≈øide, clears me from bearing any grudge, or offence of mind (upon my own, or any other Man's account) towards any Per≈øon, or Per≈øons living; and that even in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to tho≈øe, whom in the general I cannot but think and ≈øu≈øpect to be very faulty, I find not my ≈øelf otherwi≈øe affected, than mo≈øt truly to love, honour, and re≈øpect them for their <hi>Calling</hi> and <hi>Characters</hi> ≈øake. I cannot but for this rea≈øon al≈øo a little the more yield to my own <hi>fears,</hi> and think, that in <hi>fearing</hi> and <hi>judging</hi> ≈øo as <hi>I</hi> do, my fear is not altogether <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cau≈øe,</hi> nor my judgment much <hi>contrary to Truth</hi> and <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi> However, ≈øuch as they are, in order to receive your further <hi>Coun≈øel</hi> and <hi>Direction</hi> concerning them, <hi>I</hi> take the Boldne≈øs to pre≈øent them to You, in the plain Form that followeth.</p>

               <p>I meant only to in≈øi≈øt upon ≈øuch matters,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="48"/> as related to the Church, and State of <hi>England:</hi> otherwi≈øe I could willingly enough have added more, of the like evil practices, which (for my part) I cannot but a little ≈øu≈øpect, that the ≈øame parties (<hi>viz.</hi> tho≈øe of the <hi>Roman Court,</hi> and its <hi>Emi≈ø≈øaries, Agents,</hi> &amp;c.) do u≈øe in other Foreign Countries; and particularly in that ≈øo important bu≈øine≈øs of <hi>Candia,</hi> ≈øo long, and ≈øo hard be≈øieged by the <hi>Turks.</hi> I profe≈øs to you (Gentlemen) and to all the World, if you think fit, I cannot free my Thoughts from frequent ≈øu≈øpicions, and fears, that even in this great affair of <hi>Candia,</hi> the <hi>Con≈øi≈øtory</hi> proceeds not ≈øo faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, as it ≈øhould, to the Intere≈øt of Chri≈øtendom, and of tho≈øe brave Men, who have to their immortal ≈øame and merit ≈øo long defended it; corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øponding contrariwi≈øe, more or le≈øs, with tho≈øe of the <hi>Divan,</hi> and being, if not more willing it ≈øhould fall into the <hi>Turks</hi> hands, than otherwi≈øe, yet they are indifferent in the ca≈øe, and care not much though it do. That which makes me have this apprehen≈øion, are The≈øe General Ob≈øervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons following.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, I do certainly know (if their own reports be of certain credit,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52641:21"/>as I doubt not but they are in the≈øe matters) that the Je≈øuits have got a very con≈øiderable Intere≈øt even at <hi>Con≈øtantinople</hi> (and I believe even in the Court it ≈øelf) by their cunning, and compliant addre≈ø≈øes, their di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øembling in religion, where they ≈øee cau≈øe, and allowing others to do ≈øo: ≈øo that there wants no means of entertaining corre≈øpondence, if the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties be willing.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I ob≈øerve, that the <hi>Per≈øian</hi> (the <hi>Turks</hi> con≈øtant enemy, and who is known ever upon ≈øuch occa≈øions as this, to have found oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, and ≈øome pretence, or other, to invade his Dominions) doth not in all this time of his Enemies being ≈øo deeply engaged here, in any ≈øort ≈øtir again≈øt him. But 'tis alike certain, the Je≈øuits are not a little preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in that Court too, and may (for ought any Man knows to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) by their practices and arts, help to ≈øtave off ≈øuch re≈øolutions in favour of the <hi>Turk.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Gallies, ≈øent the la≈øt Summer to their Succour, under the command of his Nephew, ≈øo un≈øea≈øonably and ha≈øtily return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as creditable report ≈øays they did, and carrying off with them the Gallies of <hi>Malta</hi> and <hi>Sicily</hi> al≈øo; and thereby leaving the Seas free for the <hi>Turk</hi> to ≈øend Supplies to his Army; which by their faithful and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtant attendance upon that Service (as 'twas hoped they would have done) might, with God's ble≈ø≈øing, have been hindered: What can all this ≈øig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, but the cold, and uncordial affections, which was on that ≈øide, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ≈øafety of the place!</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the like ≈øudden return al≈øo of the greate≈øt part of the <hi>French</hi> Succours, lately ≈øent, upon a di≈øgu≈øt taken (as they ≈øay) by their General at ≈øome di≈øappointment he met with, which was occa≈øion'd by the <hi>Con≈øi≈øtory.</hi> Neither can I have any other thoughts, concerning the pre≈øent return of the Duke <hi>de Navailes</hi> with the Succours la≈øt ≈øent, than as proceeding from the prevalency of <hi>Con≈øi≈øtorial</hi> Coun≈øels, both in the <hi>French</hi> Court, in their Ships at Sea, and, perhaps, even at <hi>Candia</hi> it ≈øelf.</p>
               <p>La≈øtly, becau≈øe that to be ≈øo <hi>indifferent,</hi> and <hi>prevaricating</hi> in the bu≈øine≈øs is con≈øonant enough to the Principles they go upon in other ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes, mea≈øuring and doing all things according as Temporal Intere≈øt leads them, and nothing without it, or out of any good, and pure motives of religion. If it be demanded, what Intere≈øt the Pope, or Con≈øi≈øtory can have to advance the <hi>Turki≈øh</hi> power, I an≈øwer, very much. I do not mean ≈øo far to advance it, as to bring it over near them≈øelves. They are wi≈øer than to do ≈øo: But to detain it upon the Frontiers of Chri≈øtendom, and there to ≈øuffer the <hi>Turk</hi> rather to gain, than lo≈øe ground, I mu≈øt confe≈øs, I am more than half of opinion, it may be both the Intere≈øt, and the de≈øign of <hi>Rome:</hi> and that for this end; namely, that in ca≈øe Chri≈øtian princes
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:52641:22"/>≈øhould go about at any time, by the Authority of a General Council, effectually to redre≈øs the many abu≈øes in Religion and Church-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which are countenanced and ≈øupported by the corrupt Doctrine, and bad example of that Court, they of the Con≈øi≈øtory may have the <hi>Turks</hi> power at hand to let in upon them, to di≈øturb the work. A thing of no great difficulty for the <hi>Con≈øi≈øtory</hi> to procure by their practices and Mini≈øters in the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Court, and which without doubt they will do, when≈øoever ≈øuch a ca≈øe happens, if good heed be not taken. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (I ≈øay) they care the le≈øs at pre≈øent to permit the <hi>Turks</hi> reducing of <hi>Candia,</hi> and thereby making him≈øelf ma≈øter of the whole I≈øle of <hi>Crete,</hi> knowing they ≈øhall have him ≈øo much the nearer among≈øt us. Whereby al≈øo the <hi>Roman</hi> Agents, living di≈øguiz'd at <hi>Con≈øtantinople,</hi> gain ≈øo much the more credit there with tho≈øe they treat with, and advance their Intere≈øt in the <hi>Ottoman</hi> State and Councils.</p>
               <p>Whereas, on the other ≈øide, if the <hi>Con≈øi≈øtory</hi> were faithful in the ca≈øe, and would permit his Holine≈øs to give that a≈ø≈øi≈øtance there to him≈øelf, which he well might, and al≈øo to exhort Chri≈øtians ≈øo effectually to the defence of it, as he ought; and that Chri≈øtian Princes would rightly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the occa≈øion which God gives them, and ≈øend their Succours thither in ≈øuch unanimous and con≈øiderable manner, as the <hi>place,</hi> and <hi>cau≈øe</hi> doth mo≈øt ju≈øtly require, This Noble and Renowned <hi>Candia</hi> might, by God's merciful Providence and Favour, prove a Rock, whereon the whole Power of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Tyranny ≈øhould, in fine, ≈øplit it ≈øelf, and Chri≈øtendom be re≈øtored to its ju≈øt, primitive, and mo≈øt to be wi≈øh'd for Liberty. But alas! private Intere≈øt rules, and prevails too much every where, for ≈øuch good and publick re≈øolutions to be taken to any effect.</p>
